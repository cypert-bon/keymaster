I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes.", "The trees, therefore, must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them, deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious. At that, they probably didn't have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land. And if that were true, there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden.", "\"What is the best way to get what you want?\" she asked.

How was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her?", "It's an unfortunate reality that we don't teach people how to make money (beyond getting a 9 to 5 job) as part of our education system.

He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen.", "What was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown.

With each millimeter it advanced forward, something changed in the room. The actual change taking place was difficult to perceive, but the change was real.

The sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week, and the birds were singing in its warmth. There was no way to anticipate what was about to happen. It was a worst-case scenario and there was no way out of it.", "I haven't bailed on writing. Look, I'm generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track.
